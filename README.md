Designing and developing a relational database

This project was about designing and developing a relational database to store data for a kennel.  I worked with a team of three on this project.  We constructed a use-case diagram to show the functionality of the system, a conceptual class diagram to illustrate the main data, user views to show how the system may be used, and a data dictionary that describes the main data.  We made an external and internal data model as well.  To create the database, we used Microsoft Access.
